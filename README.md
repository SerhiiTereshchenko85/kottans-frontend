# Hello! 
My name is Sehii!
And I am grateful for this course. I wish everyone success in their studies!

# Git та GitHub
Listened to weeks 1 and 2 of the Introduction to Git and GitHub course, and
learned a lot of new things.

Namely:
1. What is version control?
2. What is Git?

Learned a lot of Git commands that I will be using.

It was surprising how effectively you can work together and exchange data with the help of version control.

In the future, I plan to use everything I learned, Git and github.
