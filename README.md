# Hello! 
My name is Serhii!
And I am grateful for this course. I wish everyone success in their studies!

# Git & GitHub.
1. Listened to weeks 1 and 2 of the Introduction to Git and GitHub course, and
learned a lot of new things.

Namely:
- What is version control?
- What is Git?

Learned a lot of Git commands that I will be using.

It was surprising how effectively you can work together and exchange data with the help of version control.

In the future, I plan to use everything I learned, Git and github.

2. Passed levels https://learngitbranching.js.org/
  - Basics: Introduction Sequence
  - Remote repositories: Push & Pull.
Here I have already practiced working with GIT. It was very interesting, exciting and sometimes not easy, but I did it.

It was new for me to see how everything works, thanks to the diagrams.

I was surprised by how easily some tasks are solved, although at first glance everything is very confusing.

In the future, I think I will look into "Learn Git Branching" for repetition of the material.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP.

1. Linux Survival (4 modules).

After going through four modules, I learned a little about Linux, or rather, many different commands with which I did not have to work in Windows. How to remember them all? :)

Almost all the commands were new to me, some are intuitive, as they are abbreviations.

Will I use them often in my daily work? I think yes.

For more details, see the [Quiz screenshots](https://github.com/SerhiiTereshchenko85/kottans-frontend/tree/main/task_linux_cli) reference.

2. HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know—Part 1.

In the first part of the article, I learned about request / response messages, found out what request methods exist and their status codes. Some codes are familiar to me, for example, everyone knows the 404 sign, the meaning of which, I think, everyone knows. I got acquainted with the structure of the URL address.
Understanding HTTP is very important and this knowledge will be useful for creating a network infrastructure.

3. HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know—Part 2.

In the second part of the article, I learned about the implementation of connections, identification / authentication and caching. Thanks to these guides, I got an idea of ??the variety of issues solved by the HTTP protocol and a sufficient number of tips for further study of this protocol.
Everything that I read in the first and second parts of the article about the HTTP protocol was new for me.

## Git Collaboration

1. In module 3, I once again listened to what github is and learned how it works with git.
In my opinion, all 4 weeks should be listened to in the first module, as this will help when creating and cloning the repository.
Learned the process of merging, fetching and pushing remote branches, and rebasing changes.

2. In the 4th module, I continued to study the tools for collaboration in Git. Learned how to use code review in github. Learned what code review is and what the code review workflow looks like. Learned how to use code review on GitHub. I also reviewed the best practices for project management and collaboration management in these projects, which was new for me.
I will put into practice everything that I learned in module 3 and 4.
