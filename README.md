# Hello! 
My name is Serhii!
And I am grateful for this course. I wish everyone success in their studies!

# Git & GitHub
1. Listened to weeks 1 and 2 of the Introduction to Git and GitHub course, and
learned a lot of new things.

Namely:
- What is version control?
- What is Git?

Learned a lot of Git commands that I will be using.

It was surprising how effectively you can work together and exchange data with the help of version control.

In the future, I plan to use everything I learned, Git and github.

2. Passed levels https://learngitbranching.js.org/
  - Basics: Introduction Sequence
  - Remote repositories: Push & Pull.
Here I have already practiced working with GIT. It was very interesting, exciting and sometimes not easy, but I did it.

It was new for me to see how everything works, thanks to the diagrams.

I was surprised by how easily some tasks are solved, although at first glance everything is very confusing.

In the future, I think I will look into "Learn Git Branching" for repetition of the material.
