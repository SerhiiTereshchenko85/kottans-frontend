# Git та GitHub
Listened to weeks 1 and 2 of the Introduction to Git and GitHub course.
Learned a lot of new things.
Namely:
- What is version control?
-What is Git?
Learned a lot of Git commands that I will be using.
It was surprising how effectively you can work together and exchange data with the help of version control.

In the future, I plan to use everything I learned, Git and github.
